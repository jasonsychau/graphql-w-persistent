## Old News

**2018-10-19 -** I appreciate the more downloads, and I also found another bug where parent entities are not returning every children data. I will look into this asap...

...Bugs are fixed. Arguments and type heirarchies are working as expected...thanks for you patience!

**2018-10-18 -** [First Hackage package release](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/graphql-w-persistent "graphql-w-persistent") is out. Querying database with multiple queries, aliases, and fragments is available while fields, linkages, and heirarchies are given to the user to define. Hopefully, more is to come!

I appreciate the many downloads, but I'm also sorry about the rough start. Since before 0.1.0.3, I've encountered several bugs and several queries were throwing errors. Some of these are now picked out, and I hope that you'll spare your patience to not turn away. I did hurry myself to release this project, but I still hope to have given a worthwhile toolkit to you...thanks for reading!
